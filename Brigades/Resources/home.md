##Project Organization

###Code for Orlando
We require that each official project has a lead. Additionally, we require that code for separate platforms have their own project leads. For example, our Pet Adoption project has different leads for iOS, Android, and the backend API. Every project README and Slack channel description have the lead's email and Slack handle so that it's easy to get ahold of. We also have a delivery lead which is responsible for keeping track of all of the official projects, allocates needed resources, steers new members towards projects which need help, and being the primary point of contact for cross-brigade collaboration.
